# @alphaxiv/agents

A TypeScript library to build agents easily for real applications. We couldn't find an open source library to fit our needs at alphaXiv so we decided to just build our own.

Nice-to-haves that other libraries should frankly steal:

- Schema-full database friendly (flat output, minimal different fields)
- Built-in way to convert agent into a CLI app (just use `.cli()` on any agent)!
- Tools can return multiple values!
- Built-in support for relevant model providers
- Idiosyncrasies of different model providers are hidden away as much as possible (i.e. no constraints on tool naming or input schema)

## TODO

- Configurable max token limit
- Configurable max turns
- Provide fall-back models
- Toggling reasoning for models that support it
- Way to get cost of agentic query across providers

## Example

### Deep research agent

TODO: Make this work

```ts
import z from "zod";
import { Agent, Tool, mapAsync } from "@alphaxiv/agents";

const searchGenerator = new Agent({
  model: "anthropic:claude-4.5-sonnet",
  name: "Generating Relevant Search Terms",
  instructions:
    "You will be given a query, and your goal is to generate relevant search terms for the query. For example, for a query like 'SFT vs RL', you should generate 'SFT', 'RL', 'SFT weaknesses', 'SFT strengths', and so on. Your goal will be to generate around 20-30 queries.",
});

const subresearcher = new Agent({
  model: "anthropic:claude-4.5-sonnet",
  name: "Determining article relevancy",
  instructions:
    `You will be given a query and a document. Your task is the following:
1. Determine if the document is relevant to the query â€“ If the document isn't relevant to the query, simply output <irrelevant-document> and do not execute step 2.
2. If the document IS relevant, write up a justification for why it's relevant and what the important tidbits are including a summary of the documents`,
});

const reducer = new Agent({
  model: "anthropic:claude-4.5-sonnet",
  instructions: ``,
  name: (input) => `Summarizing ${input.length} results`,
});

const fetchTool = await Tool({
  name: "Searching for input...",
  input: z.string().describe("Search to pass to the google search API"),
  tool: async (input: string) => {
    return await search(query);
  }
});

const deepResearchWorkflow = await Tool({
  name: "Deep research ",
  input: z.string().describe("Top level deep research query"),
  tool: async (input: string) => {
    const queries = await searchGenerator.run(input);
    const searchResults = await mapAsync(async (query) => {
      const result = await fetchTool.run(query);
      return await subresearcher.run({
        input,
        searchResult,
      });
    }));
    return await reducer.runReduce(searchResults);
  }
});

const agent = new Agent({
  model: "anthropic:claude-4.5-sonnet",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant capable of performing deep research operations",
  tools: [deepResearchWorkflow],
});

// if (import.meta.main) agent.cli()

// const result = await agent.run("Can you summarize the current debate on SFT vs RL?");

// console.log(result.finalOutput);
```
